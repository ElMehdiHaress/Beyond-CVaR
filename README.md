# Beyond-CVaR
In this work, we incorporate a new set of risks (spectral risk measures and CPT value). into learning algorithms, and we deal with the case of heavy tailed losses.  First of all,we study a general-purpose estimator of theses risks for potentially heavy tailed randomvariables, one which is easy to implement in practice.  This estimator requires nothingmore than a finite variance. We provide high-probability excess bounds and compare themwith already existing ones. Once this is established, we then derive learning algorithms which consists of a stage-wise robust gradient descent. For this procedure we provide againhigh-probability excess-risk bounds. To complement the theory we conduct empirical testsof the underlying spectral risk measures estimator and the learning algorithm derived fromit.
